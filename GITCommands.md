# Git Commands

## ***Repository*** :
A repository is a data structure that stores project or sets of project files. A developer may use a repository to store his project files and give collaborative access to other developers or to their organization. 

## ***Clone*** :
Clone is a git command that clones an existing repository and puts this new repository in a new local directory. With a clone, a developer can edit a file in their preferred file editor or development environment. 

## ***Fork*** :
Forking allows you to clone a repository on the gitHub server side. Then, you can clone it to your local system and push your new repository upstream. 

## ***Branch*** :
A branch is essentially a lightweight pointer to a commit. This allows you to “branch out”, and make a new state of your current code, while keeping your current code unaffected. So you can theoretically work on a new features to your code without interacting with your main code directly since it is stored in a branch named master.

## ***Commit*** :
A commit is essentially a revision to a file or set of files. Every time a commit is made it creates an ID string called the SHA. This is to allow developers to keep a record of all the changes made to a project.

## ***Merge*** :
What a merge does is take changes made from one branch and apply them to another branch. This is the git command software engineers can use to merge changes made in their code with their main code. 

## ***Checkout*** :
The checkout command allows you to update a repositorie’s state to a specific point in the project’s development 

## ***Push*** :
The push command allows you send changes in code to remote repositories. For example, if an organization has a repository on Github a developer may push their changes to it.   

## ***Pull*** :
The pull command allows you to fetch new code from other remote files and merge them with your current work. 

## ***Remote Add / Remove / Show*** :
These are the commands you use to work with remotes. Remotes are repositories stored on the internet or a network. With the add command you can explicitly create remote and define a url where this new repository will be stored. The remove command removes a remote. This is useful if you have a developer no longer contributing to a project. The show command allows you to view your various remote repositories. 

## ***Status*** :
The status command analyzes the current repository and determines whether or not the current repository needs any items committed. This is useful for a developer to see if they need to make any commits to the code so they don’t lose the new augmentations they made to the code. 

## ***Master Branch*** :
Master is a default name for the original local branch of a project. The master branch is ultimately the main source code of a project. After a developer has made changes to a project in separate branches they merge the code back to the master branch and that is the main
