# [Commands](Commands.md)

# [GIT Commands](GITCommands.md)
This defines the most commonly used commands in git and how they can aid in productivity for 
developers and companies. 

# How these tools aid in productivity and competitiveness 
The productivity and effectiveness of companies can be substantially improved through the use of such resources as git, Docker, automated testing and continuous integration. Through git, developers can develop repositories, or collections of project files and give collaboritive acess to other developers or organizations. With these repostories come the advent of branches. Branches are the most important fundamental behind gitFlow. Branches serve as pointers to commits. Indeed they "branch off" from the main source code, but still allow changes to be made on a seperate pointer. Then, these changes can be merged into the main code aka the main branch. Through branching, developers can have multiple different changes to projects going on which allows them to optimize making changes. Once these changes are made, these branches can integrate with the main branch and allow for greater productivity and worklfow. Through, the use of docker, developers can run virtual machines to be able to run simulates versions of their source code, allowing for them to better gauge their progress and continue working with a working model of their code.
